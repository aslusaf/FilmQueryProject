### Film Query Project

#### Description:
This is a program that allows the user to use a Java-based CLI to query a back-end database for information pertaining to films.

#### Instructions:

- Run the program.
- The user will be presented with a menu.
- Select from the options to search for a film by its film id, search for a film using a keyword, or exit the application.
  1. When the user chooses to look up a film using the film id the user will then be prompted to enter the 'film id', which will be a number.
  2. When the user chooses to look up a film using a keyword, the user will then be prompted to enter the keyword to be used in the search.
  3. When the user chooses to exit the application, the program will terminate.

#### Lessons Learned:
- I didn't run into any notable problems over the course of this particular project, but I really enjoyed getting a lot of hands on practice using JDBC/ORM to push queries to the back-end database and retrieve that information to be used in Java itself.

#### Technologies Used:

Java {

- Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)
- Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)
- Object Oriented Design (OOD), Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Custom utility class (MenuBuilder)
- Try/Catch Blocks, Error streams
- toString, hashcode, equals
- Access modifiers
- Instantiation
- Constructors / Overloaded Constructors
- Getters/Setters
- Collections
- Scanners
- Switches
- For-Each/Do-While Loops
- If/Else statements
- Overriding
- Interfaces
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
